What is, what is not & motivation
---------------------------------

`infinality-bundle` is a collection of software utilizing the power of font
rendering offered by infinality patches and `fontconfig` rules known as
`fontconfig-infinality-ultimate`.

Even though the installation of separately distributed packages (i.e.
`freetype2-infinality`, `fontconfig-infinality-ultimate` and
`cairo-ubuntu`), as present in the AUR, is relatively simple, nevertheless it
has been confusing which files should be added/removed to achieve the desired
effect. That is why, for minimum fuss and maximum convenience, a one-shot
installation solution was born in order to 1) integrate all four libraries in an
easy to install software subgroup, 2) retain their mutual compatibility, as well
as their compatibility with the rest of system resources, 3) minimize the risk
of sloppy installation and maintenance, resulting in unsatisfactory or
otherwise poor font rendering. See <<anchor-3,infinality-bundle components>>
below for detailed description of the `bundle`.

`infinality-bundle` was _not_ created to mimic font rendering known
from Windows, Apple, Ubuntu or any other operating system or platform. Natively,
they all offer a unique and distinct, high quality text representation.
However, when ``ported'' to Linux, at least Windows and Apple models seem to be
missing the feel of the original. Infinality patches offer something different
and more than any of the available rendering solutions -- even more than they do
themselves out of the box. That is why the aim of `infinality-bundle` is to
make use of the vast potential hidden in native Linux font rendering back-end
that was brought to the entirely new level by the author of infinality patches.

*Linux no more needs to reproduce well known solutions as it is capable of
proposing new ones on its own, and creating new standards just like it has been
successfully doing in other areas.* Thus, the model to follow is _not_ owned by any
particular developer, company(TM) or method of electronic text representation,
but the very traditional rules of typography and the text itself. However, when
put in the digital domain, both, despite being deeply rooted in tradition, have
somehow become new phenomena as well. As such, they require new tools and new
sophisticated technologies to serve their purposes. `infinality-bundle`
explores one of numerous possible territories that are still waiting to be
discovered.

fontconfig-infinality-ultimate vs. fontconfig-infinality
--------------------------------------------------------

Although `infinality-bundle` was entirely made possible by excellent infinality
patches, it is not compatible with generic infinality settings in every respect.

As of version `2.10.92-10`, `fontconfig-infinality-ultimate` entirely abandons
the ``nesting'' configuration model known from `fontconfig-infinality`, and
configuration templates found in `/etc/fonts/conf.avail.infinality` from now on
mimic the layout of the generic `/etc/fonts/conf.avail` as close as possible.

There are quite a few benefits of reverting to a typical `fontconfig` style
configuration:

- The infinality configuration files are hardcoded into `fontconfig` source
code, allowing for easier maintenance, building, rebuilding and porting
`fontconfig-infinality-ultimate` to other compatible operating systems. A
complete set of patches was made available, alongside modified PKGBUILD,
making the process dramatically more straightforward.

- Deploying `fontconfig-infinality-ultimate` in other Linux distributions should
require as little as applying the patches and substituting the generic
`infinality-settings.sh` with a custom one from the `bundle`.

- Using a single `fontconfig` configuration tree should help avoid potential
issues caused by injecting a complex set of additional config files into the
primary structure. The latter approach has proved to be less reliable and more
prone to problems, for instance due to accidental mutual overriding of settings
by stock `fontconfig` and the `ultimate` plugin.

Here is a short list of further most substantial differences:

- Multiple runtime settings that come with `freetype2-infinality`, including,
among other things, a selection of Windows, Apple and Ubuntu schemes were
replaced by a single new one, as needed by `fontconfig-infinality-ultimate`.
`/etc/profile.d/infinality-settings.sh` should _not_ be used in conjunction
with any other similar file either supplied with infinality sources, or with
other custom packages. Any previously installed runtime file can be safely
removed once `freetype2-infinality-ultimate` has been installed.

- `/etc/fonts/infinality/infinality.conf` was reverted to its original form. All
the settings formerly found in `infinality.conf` are now located in separate
config files available in `/etc/fonts/conf.avail.infinality`. They can be
activated as needed via symbolic links in `/etc/fonts/conf.d`.

- Per-user customizations should be located in
+
    $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fontconfig/conf.d
    $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fontconfig/fonts.conf
+
A few examples can be found in `/usr/share/doc/fontconfig-infinality-ultimate/`.
Once activated, custom settings should be honored by applications.

- Type1 fonts are enabled by default. In certain cases the use of `T1`
fonts instead of `TTF` is recommended (e.g. Lexi Mono). All Postscript fonts 
used for testing, available in Arch Linux official repositories, have proved 
to render correctly.

- Several new fonts are supported by the `bundle`, and in a few cases the
default `fontconfig-infinality` settings have been modified.

All in all, you may think of `fontconfig-infinality-ultimate` as a stock
`fontconfig` package with a hard coded infinality functionality.


[[anchor-3]]
infinality-bundle components
----------------------------

`infinality-bundle` consists of the following packages:

* `freetype2-infinality-ultimate` (incl. most recent, officially released
infinality patches and custom runtime settings)

* `fontconfig-infinality-ultimate` (incl. custom `fontconfig` files as well as the
entire generic `fontconfig` library). During installation of the package, the
generic Arch Linux `fontconfig` package and `fontconfig-infinality-ultimate-git`
from the AUR (if installed in the system) should be automatically removed and
replaced by the single `fontconfig-intinality-ultimate` from the `bundle`.
+
If for some reason the substitution cannot be performed automatically, issue
(as root):
+
    # pacman -Rdd fontconfig fontconfig-infinality-ultimate
    # pacman -U/-S fontconfig-infinality-ultimate
+
This should be safe in majority of cases as the new `fontconfig` package will
provide all the necessary dependencies for use with applications that require it.

* `cairo-infinality-ultimate` (built with `cairo-respect-fontconfig.patch`,
`cairo-1.12.8-expose_snapshot-1.patch`, as well as Ubuntu patches).

The source code is always the same as used for the official Arch Linux packages.
Always, _if_ possibleâ€¦ Arch is a bleeding edge distribution, so it may happen
that the patches needed by `infinality-bundle` have not caught up yet with the
version of a library used there. In such cases, the priority is granted to
compatibility, so that the officially available package can be used instead of
its patched version. However, it has not happened yet that the `freetype2`
libraries with updated patches were unavailable for a significantly longer
period of time.

The libraries that come with `infinality-bundle` can be safely used as
drop-in replacements for correspondng Arch Linux packages, providing fully
compatible dependencies for other applications.

[NOTE]
The beta/development/git versions of the core libraries are not and
will not be supported by the `bundle`.

[CAUTION]
`fontconfig-infinality-ultimate` distributed as a separate package via the AUR
offers exactly the same font configuration as `fontconfig-infinality-ultimate`
from `infinality-bundle`. However, they are not mutually compatible on a
package content level and therefore the AUR version _cannot_ be used as a part
of `infinality-bundle` in its present state.   +
However, the git package will soon offer exactly the same functionality as
the `ultimate` one.

The following naming convention is used throughout the `bundle` (for the initial
release of every new version of a package):

  ${pkgname}-infinality-ultimate-${pkgver}-${pkgrel+1}


[[anchor-4]]
Fonts: prerequisites
--------------------

For the best experience, it is recommended to use Microsoft font families
(most recent ones as far as possible). Free fonts should be always automatically
used as fallback ones when none of the major sets is detected. If you want to
alter the default priorities set in `60-latin.conf` and `65-non-latin.conf`, you
can do so on a user basis in your local `fontconfig` configuration files in
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fontconfig` (see examples in
`/usr/share/doc/fontconfig-infinality-ultimate/fontconfig`). If necessary, you
can modify global configuration: to do so, duplicate `60-latin.conf` and
`65-non-latin.conf` as `61-latin.conf` and `66-non-latin.conf` respectively and
save your changes in them (this should prevent them from being overwritten
during update or re-installation). In order to activate your custom
configuration, edit symbolic links in `/etc/fonts/conf.d` (as root):

  # cd /etc/fonts/conf.d
  # ln -s -f ../conf.avail.infinality/61-latin.conf .
  # ln -s -f ../conf.avail.infinality/66-non-latin.conf .

If a font is available both in `TTF` and `OTF` format, the preferred one is
usually `OTF`, as long as the `OTF` version is _not_ in early development or
experimental stage. `OTF` is a newer and easier to handle standard, and as a
successor of the TrueType format it overcomes many of its limitations. For more
information, see <<anchor-8,Further reading & references>>.


[[anchor-5]]
Installation of new fonts
-------------------------

In most cases, installation of font packages available in the official
repositories should not require any extra post installation/upgrade user action.
However, in a limited number of cases it may be necessary to verify manually
that a newly added font package hasn't installed additional `fontconfig` files
that could interfere with `fontconfig-infinality-ultimate`. Arch font packaging
guidelines do not force users to accept any but generic `fontconfig` settings, and
since they are disabled in the `bundle`, the `/etc/fonts/conf.d` directory
should remain free from interference introduced by additional `fontconfig` files.
(This is usually not the case with `fontconfig` files installed by software
packages--e.g. cups-filters, desktop environments, etc--as this kind of add ons
are mostly harmless and won't affect the rendering mechanism's behaviour.) 

Therefore, users are suggested that they pay attention mostly to unsuported font
packages available via the AUR. If it is necessary to add `fontconfig` support for
a font currently not handled by `infinality-bundle`, or if an already supported
font is renderred incorrectly with default settings, it is best to report a bug
and, as long as it is possible, changes should be made to the package, in order
to preserve it unified for all users. See <<anchor-7,Reporting bugs>> below for
further instructions.


[[anchor-6]]
User specific customizations
----------------------------

As already mentioned, users can alter the default `fontconfig` settings and
introduce new ones on the individual basis via `fontconfig` XDG directory
structure, specifically in the following locations:

  ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/fontconfig/conf.d
  ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/fontconfig/fonts.conf

It is still possible to use old locations,

  ~/.fonts.conf.d
  ~/.fonts.conf

However, since they are planned to be dropped in new `fontconfig` releases, it is
best to adjust custom configs to new standards.


[[anchor-7]]
Reporting bugs
--------------

Before reporting a bug, please make sure that <<anchor-4,font prerequisites>>
have been met and that `infinality-bundle` was properly installed in your
system. If both answers are positive, read on.

The following are considered features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- *I don't like it!*
+
Don't use it.

- *Fonts are too thin / too dark / not dark enough, etc.*
+
`/etc/profile.d/infinality-settings.sh` offers three default brightness /
darkness balance levels to choose from: it is enough to comment out the
currently active set and uncomment a different one. If the presets are still not
what you want, you can customize them to any extent you wish, on your own.

- *The rendering is not the same as in Windows (any version), Apple (any
version), Any-Other-Platform (any version). I don't like it!*
+
Let me repeat it: The intention behind the ultimate package is _not_ reproduction
of existing solutions, but creating new, distinct ones that would offer high
quality font rendering on the Linux platform, regardless of the native
language. Period.

- *`OTF` vs. `TTF` fonts*
+
If the `OTF` version of the font is freely available, or it is
generaly more popular, or the quality of the `OTF` font is higher than of the
`TTF` equivalent, always `OTF` version will be used in default `fontconfig`
settings.
+
In certain cases, e.g. when you own a commercial `TTF` font, the support for it
may be added if technically possible.

- *A font is buggy / badly coded.*
+
While this is not really a ``feature'', there are several fonts that are known to
behave badly under Linux, with or without infinality patches. In certain cases,
it is possible to introduce more or less successful workarounds (Helvetica,
Luxi Mono), whilst sometimes a font will not render correctly regardless of
tricks used (like FreeSans Regular 11px for instance).
+
To avoid problems, the most problematic fonts were substituted with
equivalent faces that should work correctly and provide almost identical
experience.

- *An updated version of a font is considered worse than its previous
version(s).*
+
In this case it is recommended to install the version that's subjectively
found better and provide changes to the `fontconfig` settings on a user basis if
necessary (see <<anchor-6,User specific customizations>>).

The following are considered bugs (and how to handle them)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- *A font is not supported by the `bundle` and/or renders
badly/incorrectly/insufficiently well with the default settings.*
+
Please, report a font in question, preferably providing a copy of it (if
possible) and a relevant description of the problem (as you can see it).

- *A font is supported by the `bundle`, but needs additional tweaking.*
+
Please, report the font, providing a detailed description of the problem and
the relevant technical information (i.e. font name, version -- `OTF`/`TTF`/`T1`,
its weight and sizes at which it does not render as expected, application it is
used in, etc).

- *A font behaves correctly in application A, but misbehaves in application B.*
+
If technically possible, the problem will be looked into and fixed.  In such a
case report the problematic font & application(s), providing all the relevant
information that may help fix the bug.
+
Bear in mind, however, that there are known differences in font rendering
between various web browser, text editors, word processors, image processing
softwares, toolkits (Qt4) and so forth. In such cases it may be impossible to
find a workaround or a fix as the problem may lie deep in the software's
concept (for example, the application may handle font rendering independently
from `fontconfig`).

[CAUTION]
If a software package is available in official Arch Linux repositories, it is
always used as a reference when fixing bugs. Custom built packages, especially
beta/development/git versions, may not work as expected and thus may not be
fully supported by `infinality-bundle`. Please, make it clear in a bug report
which is the exact version you are using.

- *Something is wrong here, and I swear on my pet's life this is not a PEBKAC.*
+
If you are sure that you have done everything you are expected to, including
putting your glasses on (if applicable) and being completely sober for at least
48 hours at the time of turning on the computer, describe your problem and I
will look into it. After all, planes still crash even when they should not by
any means.

I truly appreciate all the encouragement I received from Arch Linux users
(and not only). There are too many of you to mention. Thank you, guys.
