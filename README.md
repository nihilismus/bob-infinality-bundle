## Notes

*  At this moment these SlackBuilds are from and for Slackware Linux 14.1
*  I tried to make the minimal modificactions to the originals Slackbuilds.
*  There is not need to select a type of font rendering (Windows, Apple or Ubuntu)
   since the *"aim of infinality-bundle is to make use of the vast potential hidden
   in native Linux font rendering back-end"*. This does not mean you can not
   configure some aspects of the font rendering, please check:
   *  `/etc/profile.d/infinality-settings.sh`
   *  `/usr/doc/fontconfig-2.10.93/fontconfig-infinality-ultimate`
*  You can see the differences between the default font rendering and the patched one:
   *  Default: https://www.dropbox.com/s/xiyeyvs457nb1um/slackware-14.1-default-font.png
   *  Patched: https://www.dropbox.com/s/awqgc8wg3djviqe/slackware-14.1-patched-font.png
*  Backup /etc/fonts/ before you install fontconfig and remove any personal configuration
   (~/.fonts.conf, ~/.fonts.conf.d or ~/.config/fontconfig) to avoid any issue.
